# BLINKIT_powerbi-project
##  Description
- Data Cleaning: The raw Blinkit data was cleaned (handling missing values, formatting issues, etc.) to ensure reliable analysis.
- Data Modeling: Relationships were established between different tables (like orders, customers, products) to allow cross-table analysis.
- DAX Functions: Advanced DAX formulas were used to create custom metrics (like totals, averages, year-over-year comparisons).
- Visualization: Key visual elements like bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and slicers were used for an interactive and user-friendly experience.
- Slicers: Allow users to filter the data easily based on time periods, categories, or locations.

# Process of Building the Project
- 1) Importing Data: Data from Blinkit was loaded into Power BI.
- 2) Data Cleaning:Removed duplicates Handled missing or incorrect values Changed data types (dates, numbers, text) where needed
- 3) Data Modeling: Created relationships between tables (example: linking orders to customers or products) Star schema modeling might have been used for efficiency
- 4) Building Measures and Columns:Used DAX to create calculated columns (like profit margin, delivery time) and measures (like total sales, average rating).
- 5) Visualization:Added graphs, pie charts, cards, KPIs Added slicers for dynamic filtering (like date range, product categories)
- 6) Dashboard Design: Designed a clean, logical layout Used color coding and tooltips to make insights easier to understand
- 7) Testing and Interaction:Checked slicers and filters Made sure all graphs update properly based on user selections

# Outcome
- A professional, interactive dashboard that provides:
  - Sales insights
  - Customer behavior analysis
  - Product performance
  - Operational metrics
  - Users can quickly find insights without digging into raw data.
  - It saves time, improves decision-making, and highlights trends easily.

#  Importance of this Work
- Data Cleaning: Without cleaning, insights could be misleading. Clean data ensures accuracy.
- Data Modeling: Makes it possible to analyze across multiple datasets (example: finding top products by customer location).
- DAX Functions: Create powerful, flexible calculations that basic charts canâ€™t offer.
- Useful Graphs and Slicers: Help users interact with the dashboard and find the insights they care about.
- Professional Skill Development: Shows expertise in Power BI, data analytics, and business intelligence â€“ highly valuable skills for your career!
